Play minesweeper right in Raycast!

This is highly experimental, and a bit rough around the edges, so if you encounter any bugs, please report them.

## Functionality
It has all of the classic minesweeper functionality. 

To open a square, you either press enter or double click it, and to flag, you press CMD plus enter.<BR>
If you try to open an already opened square, it will open all the neighbouring squares.
